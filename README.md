# Templates_C++
Templates are really handy when you do not want to repeat a code. So I have done some programming using templates.
A template is simple yet a very poerfull tool in C++. Simple idea is to pass the data type as parameter and don't need to write the same code for different data type. 
Fo example you are making a calculatoor which add multipy divide and subtract numbers. The numbers can integer float double or strings. So if you will use templaes you donnnot have to write seprate code for all the data type rather you will write a general code and pass data type as parameter.

C++ adds two new keywords to support templates: ‘template’ and ‘typename’. The second keyword can always be replaced by keyword ‘class’.![templates-cpp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90936436/155078687-e8cd5d68-0ef7-4896-863c-661aecb826a2.jpg)
Compile time is the period when the programming code (such as C#, Java, C, Python) is converted to the machine code (i.e. binary code). Runtime is the period of time when a program is running and generally occurs after compile time.
# How do templates work? 
Templates are expanded at compiler time. This is like macros. The difference is, the compiler does type checking before template expansion. The idea is simple, source code contains only function/class, but compiled code may contain multiple copies of same function/class.
